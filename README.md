Title: Converting REACTOME database in JSON-LD and explore the potential in ElasticSearch/Siren investigate
Making datasets available in RDF format was at the heart of the Bio2RDF project. Now with the availability of JSON-LD standard and the scalable NO-SQL technologies (mongo, neo4J, elasticsearch), how can the Life Science Linked Data community could benefit from those newer approaches? Our goal is to create a Biomart like user interface built around Reactome, CHEBI, Uniprot and GO databases all interlinked with URIs.

Technologies: Python, JSON-LD, ElastiSearch, Siren Investigate
